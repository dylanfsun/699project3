## Abstract
Radiotherapy is a treatment for cancer in which radiation is delivered to targeted areas of the body. When used as a treatment for lung cancer, an undesired side-effect is that healthy cardiac cells nearby the targeted area can also be damaged, increasing the risk of having a cardiac event. Patients who are at high risk of having a cardiac event following radiotherapy may want to elect for different treatment options. Current methods to estimate the risk of having a cardiac event involve using patients' medical histories to create a Framingham risk score, which can be calculated using the guidelines on the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's website. This study, which is based on 62 lung cancer patients who have recieved radiotherapy, attempts to supplement the existing model of risk of cardiac event by utilizing microRNA gene expression data. After using principal components analysis to reduce the dimension of the data, we fit two models, with and without utilizing the microRNA gene expression data, and find that including the microRNA gene expression data does not significantly improve our ability to estimate the risk of having a cardiac event. 

## Introduction
Lung cancer is responsible for the most deaths out of all cancers, and is the second most common form of cancer in both men and women. One form of available treatment is radiotherapy, in which x-rays are delivered to targeted areas with the goal of destroying cancer cells. Radiotherapy is effective at destroying rapidly dividing cancer cells, but can also damage nearby healthy tissues. One goal of researchers is to assess the negative side-effects of irradiating cardiac tissue while targeting cancer cells. Larger doses of irradiation to the heart have been shown to increase the chance of having a cardiac event, which can increase the chance of death among lung cancer patients. Identifying patients who are particularly susceptible to having cardiac events could allow doctors to provide more personalized treatment recommendations. 

Besides using baseline health variables such as age and smoking status, another possible option for identifying these susceptible patients is through using microRNA expression data. MicroRNAs are post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression that have been used as biomarkers for cancer detection and prognosis. Conducting microRNA analysis is relatively cheap and effective, and so identifying patients susceptible to cardiac events using microRNA data would be both greatly beneficial and easily adoptable.

The goal of this study is determine whether or not microRNA expression data can be used to improve a model of the risk of having a cardiac event following radiotherapy, beyond what can already be drawn from standard patient medical histories.

## Methods
To assess the predictive abilities of the microRNA data, we fit two semiparametric Cox proportional hazards models to the data using the survival package in R. Both models used time to first Grade 2 or higher cardiac event (Grade 2+) as the outcome variable, and considered patients who died without experiencing a Grade 2+ cardiac event to be right censored. While Grade 3 or higher cardiac events are more dangerous and are of greater interest, time to Grade 2+ events was selected as the outcome variable due to limitations in sample size, as Grade 3+ cardiac events are rarer. The first of the two models fit to the data contained only baseline medical variables, excluding microRNA data, while the second model contained microRNA variables in addition the same baseline variables as the first model. These two nested models were compared using a likelihood ratio test, and were assessed for performance via concordance. 

Prior to fitting the models, the data was transformed to solve a few issues. The first subject in the data was missing several key variables, and was therefore excluded from the study. After removing the first subject, the dimensionality of the data was then reduced using principal components analysis. To represent the non-microRNA medical predictors, the following variables were included in the principal components analysis: mean dose of radiation to the heart, age, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, systolic blood pressure, current smoking status, treatment of high blood pressure status, and pre-existing cardiac disease. These variables were chosen because they can be used to calculate Framingham risk score, which is known in the literature to useful for modeling cardiac events. However, the Framingham risk score is typically available only for patients who do not have pre-existing cardiac disease, and was therefore missing for a large number of patients in the study and not included in the models. The top four principal components from the principal components analysis represented just over 75% of the variation in the data, and were included in the first model together with mean dose of radiation to the heart for a total of five predictor variables. 

After fitting the first model, microRNA data was added to create the second model. To include the microRNA data, we reduced the dimensionality again by using another principal components analysis, this time only including the 62 microRNA variables. The top eight principal components from this analysis, representing just above 75% of the variation, were included in the second model, along with every variable already present in the first model, for a total of thirteen variables. 

The likelihood ratio test to compare the two models was conducted using the "anova" function in R, and concordance was generated as part of the standard summary output in the coxph function. The proportional hazards assumption for both models was tested using the "cox.zph" function and did not find evidence invalidating either model. A survival curve was also produced using the "ggsurv" function.

Women in the study have much lower Framingham risk scores on average, and are therefore presumed to be at lower risk of having cardiac events. Due to these imbalances, sex was not included as a covariate in the models, as inferences made on sex differences may not have been accurate. Reported p-values are from chi-squared tests for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables.

```
This plot shows the difference in survival between people who had a mean dose of radiation of greater than 12 gray, shown with a red solid line, and those who suffered a mean dose of radtion of less than 12, shown with a blue dotted line. Patients who have suffered larger doses of radiation to the heart have an increased risk of having a Grade 2 or higher cardiac event.

The microRNA model contains all the covariates in the base model, as well as eight additional principal components taken from a separate principal components analysis of the microRNA expression data. Concordance is the proportion of pairs of cases in which the case with the higher risk had an event before the case with the lower risk. A concordance of 0.5 would imply that the model is not useful, while a concordance of 1.0 would indicate a perfect model. The reported likelihood ratio tests compare the respective models against the null model with no covariates, and lead to the conclusion that both models individually perform better than the null model. 

#### Table 3: Results comparing two nested Cox regression models

Model 1: Mean dose of radiation to the heart, medical PC1..medical PC4
 
Model 2: Mean dose of radiation to the heart, medical PC1..medical PC4, microRNA PC1..microRNA PC8

|   | df | p.value |
|---|----|---------|
| Model 1 |   |        |
| Model 2 | 8 | 0.11 |

The two nested models are compared using a likelihood ratio test. The p-value is generated from a chi-squared statistic with eight degrees of freedom. 


## Discussion
Metrics from the two models fit are shown in Table 2. The base model with just medical data performs significantly better than the null model, and is reasonably accurate with a concordance of 0.726. The second model has about the same p-value when compared to the null model, and has a slightly higher concordance value of 0.789. These values indicate that the base model with just medical data already models the data well, and that adding microRNA data does not appear to improve the concordance by much. This interpretation is solidified by the result from the likelihood ratio test comparing the two nested models shown in Table 3. With a p-value of 0.11, the second model, which incorporates microRNA data, does not significantly improve upon the base model with just medical history data. After seeing that principal components taken from the microRNA data as a whole do not improve the model, we conclude that there are no particular genes that would meaningfully improve the model on their own.
